# Javascript Beginner Code Quiz

## Description

This application was built to test the users knowledge on basic javascript coding.
It is a timed quiz that keeps track of the users score for each correct answer and has the potential to add or decrease the score depending on how quickly the quiz is completed.

This tested my skills on using APIs and DOM traversal along with storing information to the local storage.
In this version the code could still be improved but it is the beginning to understanding basics of javascript code.
